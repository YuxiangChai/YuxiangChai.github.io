I am currently a Ph.D. student in MMLab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from New York University, Tandon School of Engineering and Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, respectively. My research interests include computer vision, LLMs, and deep learning.
